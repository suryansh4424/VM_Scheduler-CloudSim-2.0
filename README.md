# VM_Scheduler-CloudSim-2.0
# Problem Statement-
In cloud computing, the efficient scheduling of Virtual Machines (VMs) across a limited number of servers is both critical and complex. With M VMs and N servers (where M greatly exceeds N), the challenge grows exponentially, with M^N possible configurations. This combinatorial explosion makes VM scheduling an NP-hard problem, posing significant obstacles to achieving optimal resource utilization.
Traditional VM scheduling algorithms typically rely on static or heuristic-based approaches, which can lead to suboptimal server states—whether underloaded, overloaded, or balanced—depending on fluctuating infrastructure demands. These methods follow three primary stages: VM selection, VM placement, and VM migration. However, they often fail to account for the dynamic nature of workloads, resulting in inefficiencies such as higher energy consumption, longer processing times, and diminished system performance.
This project aims to address these issues by leveraging AI/ML techniques to predict CPU workloads in advance, enabling a more proactive and intelligent VM scheduling strategy. By accurately forecasting future workloads, the system can allocate resources preemptively, optimizing VM placement and reducing the need for reactive adjustments. This approach seeks to strike the perfect balance between energy consumption and processing time, ensuring peak efficiency in the cloud infrastructure.
To validate this approach, the predictive model will be benchmarked against traditional heuristic methods, which rely on pre-existing data to guide VM scheduling. The comparison will focus on how well workload predictions minimize scheduling overhead, maintain a balanced server state, and respond to demand fluctuations. The goal is to demonstrate that AI/ML-powered scheduling not only enhances resource utilization but also significantly boosts the performance and sustainability of cloud computing environments.
